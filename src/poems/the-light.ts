export default `The Light

It's the
Flickering Shimmering
Endlessly unnerving
Blue light
That the television casts
In the unlit room

The audio drowns
Inside my mind
Becomes a soup
In a loop
It plays forever

A box of cereal
A gallon of milk
A Saturday night
Cause there was
Nothing better

If you could see
The darkest shadow
Hopelessly shallow
The eyes no life
Has ever seen

Silently watching
Unduly quivering
A point of view
To a better
Avenue

I have a dream...

I have a dream
To light the world
But can I even
End my night?
