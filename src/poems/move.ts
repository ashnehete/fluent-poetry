Move

What is this breeze
That I feel
Tugging me towards
An unknown direction

I'm working at this moment
I tell her that
But stubborn as she is
She believes me not

Constant pulling, constant struggle,
I take a peek
It seems ambitious and
Promising happiness

What about where I'm heading now
I have set my goals
Torn apart by the new found
Should I reconsider

Constant nagging, constant confusion,
My head is unstable
I make a move, the boldest of all
And reach for another path

Would I achieve promising happiness
I know not nor I care
Because that bold move taught me
To have faith in yourself
