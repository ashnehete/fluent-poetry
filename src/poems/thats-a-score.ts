That's a Score

I am two decades old today
And that's a score
Still there are things to do
I have never done before

This day comes too fast
You have heard the lore
Teen age is ending
Nothing I can do anymore

Now is the time
To step outside the door
Have lived my years
Being a tad bit bore

Something is about to change
I may take a detour
Not any small feat
Yet there is more

Life, is eternally short
So I say therefore
I am two decades old today
And that's a score
