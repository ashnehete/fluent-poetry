The Great Unknown of Humankind

A child, who knows no sorrow, yet cries all the time.
Or maybe, knows only that, but never watery-eyed.
A teenager, just an infant in the way of life
Fights ferociously with first pangs of love
Rejoices once achieved and cries once lost
Becomes a Man and seeks out his own
He seeks a friend for comfort in tough times,
And learns true friendship to provide the same
To share the happiness or create his own
To be alive as an independent
For soon he chances upon another individual
Decides to make a promise forever
A future unknown but hoping the best
The constant companion changes his life
A guide till the end, or leave him alright
An ecstasy which ignites, or dread it implies
Nonetheless, he must go on
As he progresses, many might add on
Many might leave, yet he must go on
A sense of ending might soon ignite
Welcoming with open arms, he must rejoice
And retrospect on a past left behind
He has done all he could, all he could has been done
Because the death knell comes knocking
And â€“ He. Is. No. More.

Thus, goes the journey of a Man
Feeble and minuscule on the scale of Time
And yet a single constant never left behind
The pit in his stomach, the throb in his chest
The pricks on his skin, the sweat on his fist
The feeling in the back of his mind
The great unknown of humankind
