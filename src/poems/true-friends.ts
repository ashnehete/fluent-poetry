True Friends

Two friends just go,
Walking down a road.
Braving a life,
That's just a simple code.

One time they reach,
A real haunted house.
Eerie and creepy,
Not just cat and mouse.

Scared but determined,
They opened the door.
The creatures were waiting,
Not one there were four.

One had the evil eyes,
Horns donned the second,
Third with the long nails,
Fourth at the end.

Thunder struck, the house shook,
The creatures growled again.
Hand-in-hand, side-by-side,
Thus the fight began.

One took the hands,
While the other took the tail.
That's one creature down,
Only three more to hell.

One by one, they all fell,
By the mighty hands of heroes.
They were just together, alright,
Apart they were zeroes.

This is a triumph of
Evil in your life.
Who says to a gun fight,
You can't bring a knife.

And then as they say,

True friends just go,
Walking down a road.
Braving a life,
That's just a simple code.
