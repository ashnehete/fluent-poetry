export default `Pretence

I am nothing, I am nobody,
Yet I have my view.
I have stands, I have opinions,
and I have things that don't matter too.

I say a thing, I do another,
I show but I am nothing like you.
I lie, and I say,
I mean it only for a few.

I sympathise, I empathise,
Even though I don't have a clue.
I go on, I never stop,
Till you beat me black and blue.

I cry, I fake,
Like a not-so-bad case of flu.
I go on, I never stop,
Till you find me something new.

I pretend, I act,
Like in a movie, on cue.
I lie, and I say,
Its just, on my face, a hue.

I am something, I am somebody,
Just not as you knew.
I have stands, I have opinions,
I am a human, is it fine with you?
